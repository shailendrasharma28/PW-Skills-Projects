        <h1 style="font-size: 50px;">2. What are HTML Entities? List out 5 commonly used HTML entities? </h1>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 20px; line-height: 30px;">
            HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have a specific meaning in HTML or cannot be typed directly. They usually begin with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). <br>

            Here are five commonly used HTML entities: <br>

            1. (&)nbsp; for a non-breaking space <br>
            2. (&)lt; for the less-than symbol (&lt;) <br>
            3. (&)gt; for the greater-than symbol (&gt;) <br>
            4. (&)amp; for the ampersand symbol (&amp;) <br>
            5. (&)quot; for the double quotation mark (&quot;) <br>

            These entities help ensure that the intended characters are displayed correctly in web browsers.

            websites and how it benefits different user group" </h1>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 20px; line-height: 30px;">
            Accessibility in the context of web development refers to the practice of making websites usable for all people, including those with disabilities. This encompasses a range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. <br>

            Creating accessible websites is essential for several reasons: <br>

            1. Inclusivity: Accessibility ensures that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can access and interact with online content. This promotes equal opportunities for all users. <br>

            2. Legal compliance: Many countries have laws and regulations requiring websites to be accessible. Compliance helps organizations avoid legal issues and penalties. <br>

            3. Improved user experience: Accessible design often leads to better usability for all users. Features like clear navigation, alternative text for images, and easy-to-read fonts enhance the overall experience. <br>

            4. Wider audience reach: By making websites accessible, businesses can reach a broader audience, including individuals with disabilities and the aging population, who may face challenges in using standard web designs. <br>

            5. Search engine optimization: Many accessibility practices, such as using descriptive headings and alt text, also improve SEO. This can lead to better visibility in search engine results. <br>

            Overall, creating accessible websites benefits diverse user groups, fosters inclusivity, and contributes to a more equitable digital environment. <br>

        <h1 style="font-size: 50px;">4. List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML </h1>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 20px; line-height: 30px;">
            Here are three ways to improve the accessibility of HTML: <br>

            1. Use semantic HTML. Employing semantic elements provides meaningful structure to the content, making it easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to interpret the layout and context of the page. <br>

            2. Provide alternative text for images. Using descriptive text helps users with visual impairments understand the content and context of images on the page. <br>

            3. Ensure keyboard navigation. Making sure that all interactive elements, such as links, buttons, and form fields, are accessible via keyboard navigation allows users to operate functionalities without a mouse. <br>
